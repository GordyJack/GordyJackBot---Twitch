Brirro: Im trying to search for ocean monuments but the chunks load so slowly
Brirro: Its a server for me and my friend, It only has 4GB rn
Brirro: I would do that, but my wifi is actually really bad
Brirro: My wireless redstone teleporter triggered somehow so now im at my base
Brirro: it is in vanilla
Brirro: I have a reciever in my base
Brirro: and when a dropper drops an item at a very certain time, it detects it somehow
Brirro: and triggers the redstone output
Brirro: I also have a pet enderdragon at the spawn point, so wireless redstone isnt the only crazy thing
Brirro: yeah  lol
Brirro: I like to have the noise in the background while im gaming
Brirro: I dont think I was
Brirro: but thats pretty cool
